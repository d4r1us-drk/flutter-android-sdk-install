## Installation Script for Flutter and Android SDK

This script installs the Flutter SDK and Android SDK Command Line Tools to `$XDG_LIB_HOME/flutter` and `$XDG_LIB_HOME/android`, respectively. If `XDG_LIB_HOME` is not set, it defaults to `$HOME/.local/lib`. The script downloads the necessary files, extracts them, and sets up the SDKs in the specified directories without modifying the system's `$PATH`.
